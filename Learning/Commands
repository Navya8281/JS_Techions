* JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

* JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
     

    - Single Line Comments
        Single line comments start with //.
        Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
        Example: 
           let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
           let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2

    -Multi-line Comments
      Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
      Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
      Example: 
          /*
          The code below will change
          the heading with id = "myH"
          and the paragraph with id = "myP"
          in my web page:
