* Variable and function names written as camelCase
* Global variables written in UPPERCASE 
* Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
* Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript names.
* Do not start names with a $ sign. It will put you in conflict with many JavaScript library names.
* In JavaScript, a common naming convention is to use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., 'myVariableName'), PascalCase for classes and constructors (e.g., 'MyClassName'), and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., 'MY_CONSTANT').
